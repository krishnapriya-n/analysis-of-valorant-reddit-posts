# Building and Analyzing the VALORANT Subreddit Corpus

### **Proposed Corpus:**
A corpus consisting of ten individual `.txt` files, each containing text data from the newest discussion posts on *r/VALORANT*. *VALORANT* is a popular free-to-play 5v5, character-based tactical shooter developed by Riot Games. Analyzing discussions on this subreddit provides insights into community trends, player feedback, and favorite aspects of the game, potentially assisting Riot Games in future development.

### **Logical Connection:**
All texts are categorized under the "Dicussion" tag to ensure they are focused on players' opinions, game insights and other topics. This similarity creates a cohesive corpus, suitable for analyzing trends and community dynamics in the game's player base.
