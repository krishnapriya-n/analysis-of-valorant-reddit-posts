# Sentiment Analysis and Community Engagement

### Introduction
Online gaming communities have become lively spaces where players connect to share strategies, celebrate achievements, discuss updates, and form lasting friendships. These platforms offer gamers a chance to interact with others who share their passion for the games they love.
Among these communities, the VALORANT subreddit (r/VALORANT) stands out as a particularly active and creative hub dedicated to Riot Games’ tactical shooter, VALORANT. Here, players exchange ideas, post artwork, ask questions, and discuss the game’s many facets—from competitive strategies to its evolving esports scene.

This project aims to explore how sentiment and post categories influence engagement within the r/VALORANT subreddit. Specifically, it investigates how the emotional tone of posts—whether positive, neutral, or negative—affects the way the community interacts with different types of content. By looking beyond basic statistics, this study seeks to uncover patterns and insights into the community’s behavior, providing a deeper understanding of how online gaming forums like this one thrive.

This project seeks to answer the following questions:
1. How do sentiment and post category (e.g., discussion, question, meme) correlate with engagement metrics such as upvotes and comments?
2. Are there significant differences in sentiment across different post categories?
3. What patterns of sentiment and engagement can provide insights into the behavior and content preferences of the r/VALORANT community?
