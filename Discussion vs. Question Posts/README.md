# Linguistic Patterns in Discussion vs. Question Posts

### Research Question: 
What are the linguistic differences between posts tagged with 'Discussion' versus 'Question' flairs in the newest 100 posts of the VALORANT community?

### Hypothesis: 
We hypothesize that posts with the "Question" flair will be shorter, more concise and use direct language, whereas "Discussion" posts will be longer, featuring more complex sentence structures while exhibiting a broader vocabulary.

Understanding these differences can provide insights into how gamers in the VALORANT community communicate when seeking help versus discussing broader topics.
