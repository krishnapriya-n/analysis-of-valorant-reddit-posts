# Analysis Across Post Categories in r/VALORANT

## Section 1: Building and Analyzing the VALORANT Subreddit Corpus
This project involves creating a structured corpus from the newest posts on r/VALORANT, categorized by their flairs (e.g., Discussion, Question). Using a Python script, text data from posts was collected and organized into ten individual CSV files, each corresponding to a specific flair. The analysis in this section provides insights into the linguistic patterns and vocabulary used within the subreddit, highlighting trends in community discussions and player feedback.

## Section 2: Linguistic Patterns in Discussion vs. Question Posts
This section examines linguistic differences between posts tagged with 'Discussion' and 'Question' flairs in the most recent 100 posts on the VALORANT subreddit. The goal is to understand how the nature of a post (whether it is a discussion or a question) influences the language used by the community.

## Section 3: Sentiment Analysis and Community Engagement
The aim of this project is to explore how sentiment and post categories affect community engagement within the r/VALORANT subreddit. Specifically, it investigates how the emotional tone of posts—whether positive, neutral, or negative—affects community interactions. By going beyond basic statistics, this study seeks to uncover patterns and insights into the community's behavior, providing a deeper understanding of how online gaming forums thrive.

## Project Context
This project was initiated for the Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing assignment at Victoria University of Wellington. It aims to demonstrate the application of sentiment analysis, linguistic pattern recognition, and social media data processing in the context of online gaming communities.
