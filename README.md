# Analysis Across Post Categories in r/VALORANT

## Section 1: Corpus Creation
This project generates a corpus consisting of text data from the newest discussion posts on r/VALORANT, with ten individual .csv files, each containing posts tagged with different flairs. Analyzing discussions on this subreddit provides insights into community trends, player feedback, and favorite aspects of the game, potentially assisting Riot Games in future development.

## Section 2: Linguistic Analysis of Post Categories
This section examines linguistic differences between posts tagged with 'Discussion' and 'Question' flairs in the most recent 100 posts on the VALORANT subreddit. The goal is to understand how the nature of a post (whether it is a discussion or a question) influences the language used by the community.

## Section 3: Sentiment Analysis and Engagement
The aim of this project is to explore how sentiment and post categories affect community engagement within the r/VALORANT subreddit. Specifically, it investigates how the emotional tone of posts—whether positive, neutral, or negative—affects community interactions. By going beyond basic statistics, this study seeks to uncover patterns and insights into the community's behavior, providing a deeper understanding of how online gaming forums thrive.

## Project Context
This project was initiated for the Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing assignment at Victoria University of Wellington. It aims to demonstrate the application of sentiment analysis, linguistic pattern recognition, and social media data processing in the context of online gaming communities.
